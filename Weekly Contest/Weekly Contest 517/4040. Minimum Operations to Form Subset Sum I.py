4040. Minimum Operations to Form Subset Sum I - Medium


You are given an integer array nums and an integer sum.

In one operation, choose an element with current value x and replace it with either 2 * x or floor(x / 2).

For each element, all multiplication operations performed on it must occur before any division operations performed on it.

Return the minimum number of operations needed so that some subset of the resulting array has a sum exactly equal to sum. If it is impossible, return -1.

The floor() function returns the integer part of the division.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,6,10], sum = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:

 - Divide nums[0] = 5 twice: 5 -> 2 -> 1, costing 2 operations.

 - Divide nums[1] = 6 once: 6 -> 3, costing 1 operation.

 - After these operations, nums = [1, 3, 10]. The subset {1, 3} sums to 4 using 3 operations in total.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,2], sum = 13

Output: 3

Explanation:

 - Divide nums[0] = 10 once: 10 -> 5, costing 1 operation.

 - Multiply nums[1] = 2 twice: 2 -> 4 -> 8, costing 2 operations.

 - After these operations, nums = [5, 8]. The subset {5, 8} sums to 13 using 3 operations in total.


Example 3:

Input: nums = [6,3], sum = 8

Output: -1

Explanation:

 - No sequence of operations lets a subset of nums sum to 8, so the answer is -1.



Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 500
1 <= sum <= 5000
