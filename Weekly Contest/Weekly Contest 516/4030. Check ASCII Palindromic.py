"""
4030. Check ASCII Palindromic - Easy


You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Construct a binary string by replacing each character in s with the 8-bit binary representation of its ASCII value, including leading zeros, while preserving the original order of the characters.

Return true if the resulting binary string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.



Example 1:

Input: s = "ff"

Output: true

Explanation:

 - The ASCII value of f is 102, whose 8-bit binary representation is 01100110.

 - Thus, the binary string is 0110011001100110.

 - Since this binary string is a palindrome, the output is true.


Example 2:

Input: s = "leet"

Output: false

Explanation:

 - The ASCII values of l, e, e, and t are 108, 101, 101, and 116, respectively.

 - Their 8-bit binary representations are 01101100, 01100101, 01100101, and 01110100.

 - Thus, the binary string is 01101100011001010110010101110100.

 - Since this binary string is not a palindrome, the output is false.



Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of lowercase English letters.
