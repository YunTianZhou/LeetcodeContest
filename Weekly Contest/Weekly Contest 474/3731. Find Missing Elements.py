"""
3731. Find Missing Elements - Easy


You are given an integer array nums consisting of unique integers.

Originally, nums contained every integer within a certain range. However, some integers might have gone missing from the array.

The smallest and largest integers of the original range are still present in nums.

Return a sorted list of all the missing integers in this range. If no integers are missing, return an empty list.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,5]

Output: [3]

Explanation:

The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5]. Among these, only 3 is missing.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,8,6,9]

Output: []

Explanation:

The smallest integer is 6 and the largest is 9, so the full range is [6,7,8,9]. All integers are already present, so no integer is missing.


Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,1]

Output: [2,3,4]

Explanation:

The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5]. The missing integers are 2, 3, and 4.



Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
