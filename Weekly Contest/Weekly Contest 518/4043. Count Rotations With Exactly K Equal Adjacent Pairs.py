4043. Count Rotations With Exactly K Equal Adjacent Pairs - Easy


You are given a string s of length n and an integer k.

A cyclic rotation of s is obtained by choosing a prefix of s whose length is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), and moving it to the end of the string while preserving the order of all characters.

For every cyclic rotation of s, let its score be the number of indices i such that 0 <= i < n - 1 and the characters at positions i and i + 1 are equal.

Return the number of cyclic rotations of s whose score equals k.



Example 1:

Input: s = "aab", k = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

The cyclic rotations of s are:

 - "aab": The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so score = 1.
 - "aba": No two adjacent characters are equal, so score = 0.
 - "baa": The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so score = 1.

Since score equals k for 2 cyclic rotations of s, the answer is 2.


Example 2:

Input: s = "abca", k = 0

Output: 1

Explanation:

The cyclic rotations of s are:

 - "abca": No two adjacent characters are equal, so score = 0.
 - "bcaa": The characters at positions 2 and 3 are equal, so score = 1.
 - "caab": The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so score = 1.
 - "aabc": The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so score = 1.

Since score equals k for only 1 cyclic rotation of s, the answer is 1.



Constraints:

2 <= n == s.length <= 100
s only consists of lowercase English letters.
0 <= k <= n - 1
