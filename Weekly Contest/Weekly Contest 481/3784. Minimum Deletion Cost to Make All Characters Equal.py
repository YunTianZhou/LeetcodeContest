"""
3784. Minimum Deletion Cost to Make All Characters Equal - Medium


You are given a string s of length n and an integer array cost of the same length, where cost[i] is the cost to delete the ith character of s.

You may delete any number of characters from s (possibly none), such that the resulting string is non-empty and consists of equal characters.

Return an integer denoting the minimum total deletion cost required.



Example 1:

Input: s = "aabaac", cost = [1,2,3,4,1,10]

Output: 11

Explanation:

Deleting the characters at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 results in the string "c", which consists of equal characters, and the total cost is cost[0] + cost[1] + cost[2] + cost[3] + cost[4] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 11.


Example 2:

Input: s = "abc", cost = [10,5,8]

Output: 13

Explanation:

Deleting the characters at indices 1 and 2 results in the string "a", which consists of equal characters, and the total cost is cost[1] + cost[2] = 5 + 8 = 13.


Example 3:

Input: s = "zzzzz", cost = [67,67,67,67,67]

Output: 0

Explanation:

All characters in s are equal, so the deletion cost is 0.



Constraints:

n == s.length == cost.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= cost[i] <= 10^9
s consists of lowercase English letters.
