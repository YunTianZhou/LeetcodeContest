3823. Reverse Letters Then Special Characters in a String - Easy


You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and special characters.

Your task is to perform these in order:

 - Reverse the lowercase letters and place them back into the positions originally occupied by letters.

 - Reverse the special characters and place them back into the positions originally occupied by special characters.

Return the resulting string after performing the reversals.



Example 1:

Input: s = ")ebc#da@f("

Output: "(fad@cb#e)"

Explanation:

The letters in the string are ['e', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'f']:

 - Reversing them gives ['f', 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'e']
 - s becomes ")fad#cb@e("

The special characters in the string are [')', '#', '@', '(']:

 - Reversing them gives ['(', '@', '#', ')']
 - s becomes "(fad@cb#e)"


Example 2:

Input: s = "z"

Output: "z"

Explanation:

The string contains only one letter, and reversing it does not change the string. There are no special characters.


Example 3:

Input: s = "!@#$%^&*()"

Output: ")(*&^%$#@!"

Explanation:

The string contains no letters. The string contains all special characters, so reversing the special characters reverses the whole string.



Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters and the special characters in "!@#$%^&*()".
