"""
4021. Minimum Operations to Make a Rotated Palindrome I - Medium


You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operations any number of times (including zero) and in any order:

 - Increment: Choose any index i and replace s[i] with the next lowercase English letter. The letter after 'z' is 'a'.

 - Left rotate: Move the first character of the string to the end.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make s a palindrome.



Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: 2

Explanation:

One optimal solution:

 - Left rotate the string: "abc" -> "bca".

 - Increment 'a' to 'b': "bca" -> "bcb".

 - "bcb" is a palindrome. Thus, the answer is 2.


Example 2:

Input: s = "yb"

Output: 3

Explanation:

 - Increment the first character three times: "yb" -> "zb" -> "ab" -> "bb".

 - "bb" is a palindrome. Thus, the answer is 3.



Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 2000
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
